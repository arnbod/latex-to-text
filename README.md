Latex to text (help to translation)
===================================

Let's translate
---------------

Do you need to translate your work in LaTeX into a foreign language? Don't have the time or skills to do it? Why not let a computer do it for you?

Machine translation has made huge progress and the text produced is quite good.

Issue with maths
----------------

However automatic translators don't like mathematics and LaTeX file. We provide here a tool to hide mathematics to the machine so that you can translate any scientific text from one language to another.


It works!
---------

These tools have been used to translate the book *Python au lycée* to *Python in high school*, more than 200 pages, in 15 workdays. See [GitHub Exo7](https://github.com/exo7math).



Requirements
------------

* Your original LaTeX file,

* a Python3 installation and all the Python files you will find in the `bin/` directory, 

* and a translator like [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator) or [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).


Operations
----------

* Use `python3 latextotext.py toto.tex` to transform a LaTeX file to a text file `toto.txt`. You will get an additional dictionary `toto.dic`.

* Don't panic if you see lots of tags `€1234€`, they replace maths and LaTeX commands!  

* Use automatic translation on the text file, I recommend [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator), save the file in your target langage as `new_toto.txt`.

* Recover your LaTeX file with `python3 texttolatex.py new_toto.txt toto.dic`, you will get a
file `new_toto.tex` in your target langage with your original maths.

* You certainly need to check and correct the translation.


Example
-------

1. Start from a file `maths.tex` written in French:
```
	...
	Soient $f$ et $g$ deux fonctions continues de $\mathbf{R}$ vers $\mathbf{C}$.
	...
```


2. Execute `python3 latextotext.py maths.tex`.

3. You will get a file `maths.txt`:
```
	...
	Soient €0€ et €1€ deux fonctions continues de €2€ vers €3€.
	...
```

4. And a file `maths.dic`:
```
	0: $f$
	1: $g$
	2: $\mathbf{R}$
	3: $\mathbf{C}$
```

5. Translate the file `maths.txt` to English using DeepL and name the translation `new_math.txt`:
```
	...
	Let be €0€ and €1€ two continuous functions from €2€ to €3€.
	...
```

6. Execute `python3 texttolatex.py new_maths.txt maths.dic` to get a file `new_maths.tex`:
```
	...
	Let be $f$ and $g$ two continuous functions from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{C}$.
	...
```

7. Adjust the translation by hand:
```
	...
	Let $f$ and $g$ be two continuous functions from $\mathbf{R}$ to $\mathbf{C}$.
	...
```

Advice if you use ChatGPT for translation
-----------------------------------------

* The limit size for a message to ChatGPT is 4096 characters.

* You may need to repeat the instructions to ChatGPT in every message, since ChatGPT tends to forget them.

* You can adapt and use the prompt below.

````
Translate from French to English extracts from my article about mathematics.
Do not replace the patterns €number€. They are tags standing for LaTeX code.
When punctuation seems missing after a tag, it's probably part of what the tag stands for.
So, DO NOT add missing punctuation after a tag.
Your output will be encapsulated in blockquote markdown (```like this```).
Consider using the following dictionary, in the format "{original: correct translation}", updated from your previous mistranslations.
{
partie: subset
Abélien: Abelian
application: map
noté: denoted by
}
